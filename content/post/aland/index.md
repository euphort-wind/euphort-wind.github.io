## Organize your notebooks

Place the notebooks that you would like to publish in a `notebooks` folder at the root of your website.

## Import the notebooks into your site

```bash
pipx install academic
academic import 'notebooks/**.ipynb' content/post/ --verbose
```

The notebooks will be published to the folder you specify above. In this case, they will be published to your `content/post/` folder.
