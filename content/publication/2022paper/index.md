abstract: This article presents the authorâ€™s concept for measuring employee engagement and explores ways to enhance it through the use of a hybrid meeting room. The main objective is to examine the proposed hybrid workspace model and assess its applicability for improving workflow organization within a company. The study addresses the challenge of low engagement often observed in remote work settings. To investigate this issue, a combination of empirical (interviews, surveys, experiments), theoretical (engagement level modeling, workflow system modeling), and practical (data visualization, component programming) methods were employed. As a result of the research, a prototype of a hybrid meeting room was developed, serving as a proof of concept for the hybrid workspace approach.
