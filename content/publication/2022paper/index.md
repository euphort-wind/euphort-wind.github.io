abstract: This paper presents a conceptual framework for measuring employee engagement and explores strategies to enhance it through the implementation of a hybrid workspace model. The study addresses the persistent issue of low engagement frequently observed in remote work environments. To investigate this problem, a mixed-method approach was employed, integrating empirical methods (interviews, surveys, experiments) with theoretical modeling (development of engagement and workflow models). The study identified a set of key factors representing bottlenecks in remote work processes, which informed the design of a prototype hybrid meeting room. This prototype serves as a proof of concept for the proposed hybrid workspace model and demonstrates its potential to improve employee engagement and organizational efficiency.
