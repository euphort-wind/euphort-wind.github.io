abstract: This paper presents the concept of a game-based educational product aimed at supporting interdisciplinary learning among school students. The proposed gamification-based product integrates elements of quest games, role-playing games, and visual novels to foster student engagement and enhance learning outcomes. The architecture of the product was developed based on the requirements from the client, and a functional prototype was implemented, featuring the main menu, ranking system, progression map, and an assessment platform. The concept was evaluated in a school setting, and the proposed solution was further substantiated through market and competitor analyses, demonstrating its pedagogical relevance and potential competitiveness within the educational technology domain.
