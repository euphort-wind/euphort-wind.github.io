abstract: This article presents the concept of a game-based educational product designed for interdisciplinary learning among schoolchildren. The gamified educational system incorporates elements of a quest, role-playing game, and visual novel. A prototype layout of the game was developed, featuring a main menu, rating system, stage map, and testing area.
